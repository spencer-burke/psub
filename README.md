This tool submits flags to pwn college.
As of now I am not including a license in this code because I do not know where this project will go.
As of 1/3/2020 this code is not original nor do I take any credit for it. It was written by someone else and I plan to refactor and adapt it into a terminal tool for all of my pwncollege submitting needs.
^^ This all needs to be changed
